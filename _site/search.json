    "text": "My current and past research focuses on data-driven material design as well as the capture of (experimental) data in a machine-actionable form ‚Äî which is pivotal to power data-driven approaches.\nThe central theme of my research is that material design is a very complex, mulitscale process that often involves questions that are not easily answered by simulations. Machine learning can help to address these questions and thereby accelerate material design and discovery and enable the development of new materials and yield to new insights.\n\n\nFor an overview of this research, see our Chem. Rev. as well as our perspective in JACS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ecosystem for digital reticular chemistry.\n\n\n\n\nA key challenge in data-driven material design, in particular for reticular chemistry, has been the lack of a comprehensive and open-source ecosystem for machine learning on reticular materials. To address this we have been developing an open-source ecosystem for digital reticular chemistry, called mofdscribe. This ecosystem provides tools that accompany practioners along the entire data-driven design workflow: from data to publication. For this toolbox, we also developed and generalized a range of featurizers, i.e., methods to convert crystal structures into fixed-length vectors, which can be used to train machine learning models. For multiple featurizers, we could show that the generalization greatly improves the performance of the models.\n\n\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this work is that we have shown that it is very easy to do machine-learning on crystallographic data incorrectly‚Äîand that this can lead to very misleading results.\nYou can find more details in the paper and on the open source page.\n\n\n\nGiven the tools and datasets mofdscribe provides of this, we can now use machine learning tools to address challenging material design problems.\nOver the last years, we have been doing this from the atom scale up to the pilot plant scale:\n\nFor instance, we have developed a machine learning model that can predict the oxidation state of metal-cations in MOFs. This is interesting, because oxidation states are key part of chemical reasoning (they are even part of the names of the chemicals) but not quantum-mechanical observable. Using a chemically-informed model, we could greatly outperform the state-of-the-art and show that the model reasons about the oxidation state in a way that is consistent with chemical intuition. For more details, see the paper.\nBeyond this, we have also been using machine learning to predict the color (see paper) as well as gas adsorption properties (see paper) of MOFs.\nRecently, we have shown how we can use machine-learning to forecast the amine emission from a carbon capture pilot plant, that is fed using a slipstream from a real power plant (see paper).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA digital assistant for chemists.\n\n\n\n\nHow can we generate an effective assistent for chemists that can answer questions such as ‚Äúfind all MOFs that can made in one step in a solvothermal synthesis in water?‚Äù To answer questions like these, we need data in a form that cannot only be read by a machine, but also understood in order to perform actions.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure that data is an afterthought in chemistry, I got involved in the development of an open-source ELN, the cheminfo ELN (which development is lead by Luc Patiny, our perspective article gives a good overview of our vision for the development of this platform). In contrast to many other ELNs, machine-actionable data is at the core of the ELN. This enables us to perform various actions on the data, directly in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredict or look up XRD patterns on the fly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital supporting information. The data is machine actionable and alive."
