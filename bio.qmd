Kevin Jablonka obtained his bachelor’s degree in chemistry at TU Munich. He joined EPFL for his master’s studies (and an extended study degree in applied machine learning), after which he joined Berend Smit’s group for a Ph.D. He now leads a research group at the Helmholtz Institute for Polymers in Energy Applications of the University of Jena and the Helmholtz Center Berlin. Kevin’s research interests are in the digitization of chemistry. For this, he has been contributing to the cheminfo electronic lab notebook ecosystem. He also developed a toolbox for digital reticular chemistry. Using tools from this toolbox, he addressed questions from the atom to the pilot-plant scale. Kevin is also interested in using large language models in chemistry and co-leads the ChemNLP project (with support from OpenBioML.org and Stability.AI).
