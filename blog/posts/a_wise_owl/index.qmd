As I reflect on the past and on the upcoming year, I really enjoyed [Rockefeller's favorite poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wise_Old_Owl) [@Housel2020-tx].

> A wise old owl lived in an oak,
> 
> The more he saw, the less he spoke
> 
> The less he spoke, the more he heard,
> 
> Now, wasn't he a wise old bird?
