I aim high. Most often, I don't reach there, but here are ten reasons why I still try:

1. It is fun.

2. It gives me freedom. Focusing on "low-hanging fruits" or shorter-term goals shrinks the solution space. Aiming further, my solution space expands and easily accommodates detours.

3. It demands creativity. Most challenging problems can't be solved with existing tools, forcing creative solutions.

4. [It often isn't that much harder.](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/)

5. [Something that is hard for you likely is impossible for your competitor.](https://paulgraham.com/wealth.html)

6. It lets me ignore noise. With a longer path ahead, I can tune out distractions (like most new papers) along the way.

7. It allows me to relax.

8. Even failing might leave you with something quite impactful.

9. Growth only happens by crossing boundaries.

10. It changes your default.
