Starting from my undergrad at TU Munich, I have been a teaching assistant and mentoring students.\n\n\nOne of my favorite teaching experiences was developing what we call a ‚Äúvirtual laboratory.‚Äù\n\nFor more details, you can check out our paper in J.

    "text": "My current and past research focuses on data-driven material design as well as the capture of (experimental) data in a machine-actionable form ‚Äî which is pivotal to power data-driven approaches.\nThe central theme of my research is that material design is a very complex, mulitscale process that often involves questions that are not easily answered by simulations. Machine learning can help to address these questions and thereby accelerate material design and discovery and enable the development of new materials and yield to new insights.\n\n\nFor an overview of this research, see our Chem. Rev. as well as our perspective in JACS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ecosystem for digital reticular chemistry.\n\n\n\n\nA key challenge in data-driven material design, in particular for reticular chemistry, has been the lack of a comprehensive and open-source ecosystem for machine learning on reticular materials. To address this, we have been developing an open-source ecosystem for digital reticular chemistry, called mofdscribe. This ecosystem provides tools that accompany practioners along the entire data-driven design workflow: from data to publication. For this toolbox, we also developed and generalized a range of featurizers, i.e., methods to convert crystal structures into fixed-length vectors, which can be used to train machine learning models. For multiple featurizers, we could show that the generalization greatly improves the performance of the models.\n\n\n\nAnother exciting aspect of this work is that we have shown that it is straightforward to do machine-learning on crystallographic data incorrectly‚Äîand that this can lead to very misleading results.\nYou can find more details in the paper and on the open source page.\n\n\n\nGiven the tools and datasets mofdscribe provides of this, we can now use machine learning tools to address challenging material design problems.\nOver the last years, we have been doing this from the atom scale up to the pilot plant scale:\n\nFor instance, we have developed a machine learning model that can predict the oxidation state of metal cations in MOFs. This is interesting because oxidation states are a key part of chemical reasoning (they are even part of the names of the chemicals) but not quantum-mechanical observable. Using a chemically informed model, we could vastly outperform the state-of-the-art and show that the model reasons about the oxidation state in a way that is consistent with chemical intuition. For more details, see the paper.\nBeyond this, we have also been using machine learning to predict the color (see paper) as well as gas adsorption properties (see paper) of MOFs.\nRecently, we have shown how we can use machine learning to forecast the amine emission from a carbon capture pilot plant that is fed using a slipstream from a real power plant (see paper).\n\n\n\n\nThe power of machine learning in material discovery is that it can help us build a map of the chemical space. Equipped with this map, we can explore the chemical space more efficiently.\n\nDoing this for the design of materials is, however, complicated by the fact that we need to optimize multiple properties at the same time. There are often trade-offs between the properties we want to optimize, i.e., we cannot find a single optimum spot on the map, and the best we can do is to find the set of the best compromises. To avoid introducing biases in this process, we have implemented a method that allows to identify this set of best compromises (the Pareto frontier) with high confidence. You can find more information about this in our paper and an open-source implementation on GitHub.\n\n\n\nFor machine learning to work, it is important to work on actionable representations that are predictive. I think thank foundation models can help us reveal some of the tacit knowledge of chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA digital assistant for chemists.\n\n\n\n\nHow can we generate an effective assistant for chemists to answer questions such as ‚Äúfind all MOFs that can be made in one step in a solvothermal synthesis in water?‚Äù To answer questions like these, we need data in a form that cannot only be read by a machine but also understood in order to perform actions.\n\n\n\nIn order to ensure that data is an afterthought in chemistry, I got involved in the development of an open-source ELN, the cheminfo ELN (which development is led by Luc Patiny, our perspective article gives a good overview of our vision for the development of this platform). In contrast to many other ELNs, machine-actionable data is at the core of the ELN. This enables us to perform various actions on the data directly in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases, we can only make sense of experimental data if we compare it to theoretical predictions. For instance, isotherms measure how much gas a material can adsorb as a function of pressure. Clearly, it can adsorb more if there are defects, such as missing linkers, and less if it is incompletely activated. However, to make those statements, one needs to compare to the isotherm of the ‚Äúideal‚Äù material. This is something one can do with simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredict or look up XRD patterns on the fly.\n\n\n\n\nTo make such comparisons routine ‚Äî but also to create rich datasets with data from both simulations and experiments ‚Äî we made it very easy to ‚Äúrequest‚Äù simulations from within the ELN, by linking it to simulation platforms such as AiiDAlab or web services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital supporting information. The data is machine actionable and alive.\n\n\n\n\nOnce data is stored in a digital and machine-actionable form, we can use it to create electronic supporting information documents with just one click. In the cheminfo ELN, we make this possible by allowing users to export all their data to Zenodo. There, the data is accessible in a machine-actionable form and can interactively be explored in the browser. You can find an example of such a supporting information document here."

We will have multiple fully funded positions starting in summer/fall 2023.\nTogether, we will create impactful methods for accelerated material discovery across scales‚Äîultimately helping us identify materials that work in the real world while also increasing understanding of why those materials work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will build digital assistants for chemists.\n\n\n\n\nThe design and discovery of new molecules and materials is slow. A major reason for that is that our research approach often relies on trial-and-error and is bottlenecked by information transfer: We would greatly benefit from having all information as well as intuition of all chemists at our fingertips. Machine learning can help us democratize access to this expert knowledge and help us navigate high-dimensional design spaces. In our lab will develop data-driven strategies for designing materials that work in the real world around three main research pillars: 1) Novel inductive biases (including ‚Äúsoft‚Äù inductive biases via LLMs), 2) Human-in-the-loop active learning, and 3) Novel learning paradigms. We will develop robust open-source software and also contribute to international research data initiatives. The PostDoc position will have a focus on this research data management aspect and the use of novel tools (such as LLMs) in this context.\n\n\n\nWe will design digital tools for designing polymers.\n\n\nDue to their unique tunability (and the correspondingly large design space) and functionality, we will focus on polymers, where we will closely collaborate with world-leading experimental partners to validate our predictions and build novel modeling and data frameworks.\nFor more background on my thinking see this website and my publications, you can contact him me email or on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nSome background in chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or related fields. \nMotivation for working on challenging projects, passion for scientific research, and thrive for excellence.\nStrong teamwork and communication skills.\nGrowth mindset and inclusive team culture.\nExcellent written and oral communication skills in English.\nIdeally, programming and machine learning experience (e.g., in Python, Julia).\n\nList not exhaustive, if you are interested and think you might fit, please reach out.For the Ph.D.¬†positions a Master‚Äôs degree or a four- or five-year Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or related fields. Without Master‚Äôs degree we will need to ask for an exception that is typically granted.\nFor the PostDoc positions a Ph.D.¬†is required for employment.\n\n\n\n\nBe part of the story from the beginning when we start up an ambitious research program on digitizing chemistry and materials science.\nBecome part of an international and interdisciplinary research group within a scientific network that offers research and infrastructure at the highest level.\nWe collaborate with world-leading experimental groups in Jena as well as the Helmholtz Center in Berlin that have access to unique high-throughput experimentation as well as characterization setups.\nParticipate in international and national conferences, summer schools, and workshops (we have allocated a significant amount of resources for travel).\nBesides excellent in-house computational infrastructure (you will have multiple A100 cards waiting for you), Kevin is co-leading the ChemNLP project, for which we have access to resources from Stability.ai\nBecome part of a research group that cares about your personal development: We will create tailored personal development plans, that we review every year.\nA family-friendly working environment with a variety of offers for families: University Family Office (JUniFamilie) and flexible childcare (JUniKinder). University health promotion and a wide range of university sports activities.\nAttractive fringe benefits, e.g., capital formation benefits (VL), Job Ticket (benefits for public transport), and an occupational pension (VBL)\n30 days of recreational leave in the calendar year plus one day off for Dec.¬†24 and Dec.¬†31 that should be taken without any guilt.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to do a master thesis, internship or simply connect, please reach out, too.\n\nSubmit your application via this form\nSelected candidates will be invited first to a non-technical discussion and then in a second round of a technical interview (including a ~25 minutes presentation).\n\nCandidates with disabilities will be given preference in the case of equal qualifications and suitability.\nWe will provide support for visa applications and any other potential relocation issues.\nWe will also support fellowship applications if you would prefer joining the lab on your own funding. Reach out for more details on suitable fellowships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be a group in which we all work and grow together - including our digital agents.\n\n\nAt the Friedrich Schiller University (FSU) people from a wide range of (cultural and academic) backgrounds study and work together. At FSU, and in particular in our group, we see diversity as a strength and key for our success. We rely on different ways of thinking to create the most impactful research. Our group will be a place in which everyone‚Äìirrespective of the background feels safe and will be successful.\n\n\n\n\nThe Friedrich Schiller University is a traditional university with a strong research profile rooted in Jena, at the heart of Germany. Since its foundation, it has been one of Germany‚Äôs most famous places to study, where outstanding academics like Goethe and Schiller left their marks. As a university covering all disciplines, it offers a wide range of subjects. Its research is focused on the areas Light‚ÄîLife‚ÄîLiberty. It is closely networked with non-research institutions, research companies (links going back to Carl Zeiss, Otto Schott, and Ernst Abbe) and renowned cultural institutions. With around 18,000 students and more than 8,600 employees, the university plays a major role in shaping Jena‚Äôs character as a cosmopolitan and future-oriented city (of around ~100 000 inhabitants). In Switzerland, I learned to love spending time in nature. One reason I like Jena is that you can be out in Nature by just walking a few minutes starting at the city center.\nOverall, Germany is a beautiful and safe country with great work-life balance and life satisfaction.\nYou will receive a very competitive salary with which you will live comfortably and save money for leisure activities. Students need approximately 700 EUR monthly for rent, food, health insurance, books, and personal items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenderings of the new building our lab will be located in (opening fall 2023)\n\n\nOur lab (CZS Research group ‚ÄúPolymers for energy applications‚Äù) will be located in the newly constructed Center of Energy and Environmental Chemistry Jena II at the Landgrafencampus (close to one of the best viewpoints of the city), where four new buildings with ca. 7500 m¬≤ lab space have been built over the last 10 years.\nFrequently, start-companies involving Ph.D.¬†students and Postdocs are created, and a new incubator for chemistry related start-ups is currently built next to the campus.\n\n\n\nOur group is supported by the Carl-Zeiss Stiftung, the Helmholtz-Center Berlin and integrated in multiple collaborative research centers."

    "text": "To design new materials, we need to know their properties. There are two main routes to get the properties of a material:\n\nPerform an experiment to measure them\nPerform a simulation to ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù them in silico\n\nIn many cases, performing an experiment is time-consuming and, hence, expensive. Also high-fidelity simulations can be very costly. Fidelity expresses the exactness with which a surrogate represents the truth. In the context of ML you might also see the term multi-fidelity, which means that the approach uses multiple approximations with different levels of fidelity, e.g.¬†density-functional theory and coupled cluster theory\nTherefore, there is a need for methods that can help us to predict the properties of materials with high fidelity and low cost. In this lecture, we will see that supervised machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool to achieve this goal.\nInterestingly, this tool can be used in many different ways.\n\n\nMachine learning can be used in multiple ways to make high-fidelity predictions of materials less expensive. Note that reducing the cost has been a challenge for chemists and material scientists for a long time. Dirac famously said ‚ÄúThe fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved. [‚Ä¶] approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation‚Äù\n\n\n\nMachine learning (green boxes) can be used at multiple places in the material design process.\n\n\n\nReplace expensive evaluation of the potential energy surface \\(U(\\mathbf{X}, \\{\\mathbf{Z}\\})\\): Quantum chemistry as a field is concerned with the prediction of the potential energy surface \\(U(\\mathbf{X}, \\{\\mathbf{Z}\\})\\) of a system of atoms of types \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) at positions \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Quantum chemists have developed different approximations to this problem. However, since they are all kinds of functions that map positions of atoms (and atom types, and in some cases electron densities/coordinates) to energies, we can learn those functions with ML.\nNote that once we have done that, we generally still need to perform simulations to extract the properties of interest (e.g.¬†as ensemble averages).\nThere are many good review articles about this. For example, see this one by Unke et al. as well as the ones by Deringer et al. and Behler in the same issue of Chemical Reviews.\nDirectly predict the properties of interest Instead of computing the properties of interest using a molecular simulations, we can build models that learn the \\(f(\\mathrm{structure}) \\to \\mathrm{property}\\) mapping directly. The basis for this mapping might be experimental data or high-fidelity computational data.\nAlso about this approach, there are many review articles. I also wrote one, focussing on porous materials.\n\nNote that in the context of using ML for molecular simulations, it can also be used to address sampling problems. We will not cover this in detail in this lecture. For a good introduction, see the seminal paper by Noe and a piece about it by Tuckerman."

a model. We will use a gradient boosting regressor from scikit-learn. We will also split the data into a training and a test set. In later sections, we will see why this is important. But for now, let us us just appreciate that a test set‚Äîconformers we did not train on‚Äîwill give us a measure of how well our model will perform on new, unseen, conformers.\n\npositions = data[coordinate_names] # X\nenergies = data['energy'] # y\n\n# split into training and test set\ntrain_points = 3000\ntrain_positions = positions[:train_points]\ntest_positions = positions[train_points:]\ntrain_energies = energies[:train_points]\ntest_energies = energies[train_points:]\n\n# train a model\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor\nmodel = HistGradientBoostingRegressor()\nmodel.fit(train_positions, train_energies)\n\nHistGradientBoostingRegressor()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook. On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.HistGradientBoostingRegressorHistGradientBoostingRegressor()\n\n\nOnce we have trained a model, we can use it to predict the energies of new conformers.

That is, if we translate a molecule along \\([1, 1, 1]\\), the energy should not change.\n\n# translate the molecule along [1, 1, 1]\ntranslated_positions = train_positions + 1\ntranslated_predictions = model.predict(translated_positions)\ndensity_scatter_with_hist(train_energies.values, translated_predictions)\n\n<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Actual', ylabel='Predicted'>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not what we expect. Our model shows completly unphysical behavior and predicts a different energy for the same conformers in different positions in space.\nTo fix this, and related problems, we need to use a more elaborate approach to building a model.\n\n\n\nMmaking predictions invariant/equivariant to transformations\nInvariance and equivariance are terms that have become very relevant in ML. It is always important to mention with respect to what operation something is invariant and equivariant; if people don‚Äôt mention this they often refer to the symmetry operations of the Euclidean group which comprises all translations, rotations, and reflection. Invariant means that the property of interest does not change under those operations. Equivariant means that it changes in the same way. The energy, for example, is invariant and the forces are equivariant.\n\nWhat are symmetries we would like to respect?\nBefore we can talk about how to build a model that respects symmetries, we need to know what symmetries we would like to respect.\nIn the case of molecules, we would like to respect the following symmetries:\n\ntranslation: that is, if we move a molecule along a vector, the energy should not change (see above)\nrotation: that is, if we rotate a molecule, the energy should not change\npermutation of atoms: that is the order with which we put the atoms in the model does not matter\n\nFor crystals, we additionally need to respect periodicity. That is, for intensive properties, there should be no difference between using a unit cell or a super cell of that unit cell as input for a model.\nBroadly speaking, there are three different ways to build models that respect symmetries.\n\nData augmentation: This is the most straightforward approach. We can generate new data points by applying the symmetries to the existing data points. For example, we can generate new conformers by rotating the existing conformers. This approach is very simple to implement, but it can be very expensive. For example, if we want to generate new conformers by rotating the existing conformers, we need to generate a new conformer for every rotation. This approach is often used for computer vision pipelines in which you might want to detect a cat in an image independent of the orientation. In this case, you can generate new images by rotating the existing images.\nFeatures that are invariant/equivariant : This approach is more sophisticated. We can build features that are invariant/equivariant to the symmetries we want to respect. For example, we can build features that are invariant to rotation. In the case of force field such features are bond lengths and angles. This is approach is widely used in ML for chemistry and materials science.\nModels that are invariant/equivariant: Alternatively, one can build special models that can consume point clouds as inputs and are equivariant to the symmetries we want to respect. We will not discuss this in detail, but you can find starting points in this perspective by Tess Smidt.\n\n\n\nInvariant/equivariant features\n\nSymmetry functions\n\n\nFingerprints\n\n\nCorrelation functions\n\n\nSymmetry functions\n\n\nCheaper computations"

To realize this, it is useful to formally write down what we mean by a good model.\n\nEmpirical risk minimization\nLet‚Äôs assume we have some input space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and some output space \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). We can think of \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) as the space of all possible inputs and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) as the space of all possible outputs. For example, \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) could be the space of all possible molecules and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) could be the space of all possible energies. We want to learn a function \\(f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}\\) that maps inputs to outputs. We can think of \\(f\\) as a model that we want to train.\nTo build this models we have samples of the joint distribution \\(p(x, y)\\), where \\(x\\) is an input and \\(y\\) is the corresponding output. We can think of this as a set of data points \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\).\nIf we now define a loss function \\(L\\) we can compute the risk, which is the expected value of the loss function:\n\\[\nR(h)={\\mathbf  {E}}[L(f(x),y)]=\\int L(f(x),y)\\,dP(x,y).\n\\]\nour goal is to find a model \\(f\\) that minimizes the risk:\n\\[\n{\\displaystyle h^{*}={\\underset {h\\in {\\mathcal {H}}}{\\operatorname {arg\\,min} }}\\,{R(h)}.}\n\\]\nIn practice we cannot compute this. The reason is that we do not have access to the joint distribution \\(p(x, y)\\), but only to a finite set of samples \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\).\n\n\n\nLinear regression\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\n\ndef linear_regression(x, w, b):\n    return jnp.dot(x, w) + b\ndef loss(w, b):\n    prediction = linear_regression(x, w, b)\n    return jnp.mean((prediction - y) ** 2)\ndef init_params(num_feat):\n    return np.random.normal(size=(num_feat,)), 0.0\nloss_grad = jax.grad(loss, argnums=(0, 1))\nlearning_rate = 1e-6\nnum_epochs = 1000"

    "text": "Feature selection\n\nCurse of dimensionality\nFor understanding the curse of dimensionality, it is useful to consider a very simple ML model, the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors model. In this model, we have a set of training points \\(\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}\\), where \\(x_i\\) is a vector of features and \\(y_i\\) is the corresponding label. To make a prediction, we compute the distance between the input and all training points and return the mode of the labels of the \\(k\\) closest training points.\nClearly, in this algorithm it is important to find the nearest neighbor. In general, this is important in many algorithms, for instance also in kernel-based learning.\nLet‚Äôs now ask ourself what part of the space we need to find the nearest neighbors.\n\nFor this, let‚Äôs start considering a unit cube \\([0,1]^d\\) and \\(n\\) data points \\(x_i\\) sampled uniformly from this cube.\nThe smallest hypercube that contains \\(k\\) out of the \\(n\\) points has the following edge length\n\\[\nl^d = \\frac{k}{n} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad l = \\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^{1/d}\n\\]\nIf we plot this for different values of \\(d\\) we get the following plot:\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np \n\ndef length(d, k=5, n=10_000):\n    return (k/n)**(1/d)\n\nd = np.arange(1, 1000)\n\nplt.plot(d, length(d))\nplt.xlabel('numbr of dimensions')\nplt.ylabel('length of hypercube that contains k neighbors')\n\nText(0, 0.5, 'length of hypercube that contains k neighbors')\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, for large \\(d\\) the length approaches 1‚Äîwhich means that all points are now almost equally far apart and comparing distances no longer makes much sense.\nWe can also check this by performing a simulation: Generating random \\(d\\) dimensional points and computing the distance between them. We can then plot the distribution of distances.\n\nfrom scipy.spatial import distance_matrix\ndimensions = [2, 5, 10, 100, 10_000]\nnum_points = 1000\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(dimensions), sharey='all')\n\ndef get_distances(d, num_points):\n    points = np.random.uniform(size=(num_points, d))\n    distances = distance_matrix(points, points)\n    return np.array(distances).flatten()\n\nfor d, ax in zip(dimensions, axes):\n    distances = get_distances(d, num_points)\n    ax.hist(distances, bins=20)\n    ax.set_title(f'd={d} \\n cv={distances.std()/distances.mean():.2f}')\n\n\n\n\nClearly, for large \\(d\\) the distances are almost the same (the histograms are much more peaked). We can also see this in terms of the coefficient of variation (cv), which is the standard deviation divided by the mean. For large \\(d\\) the cv is very small, which means that the distances are very similar.\n\n\nFeature selection approaches"
