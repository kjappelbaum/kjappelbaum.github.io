    PyePAL implements the e-PAL algorithm for Pareto active learning. 
    It comes with interfaces for a range of machine learning models, including scikit-learn, GPy, and jax. 
    It generalizes to any number of objectives and also supports batches sampling as well as various 
    schedulers for (re)-training the model.
