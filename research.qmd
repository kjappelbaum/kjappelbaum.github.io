# ðŸ§ª Research

My current research focuses on data-driven material design as well as the capture of (experimental) data in a machine-actionable form --- which is pivotal to power data-driven approaches.

## Data-driven material design

For an overview of this research, see our [Chem. Rev.]() as well as our [perspective in JACS]().

#### From atom to pilot plant

#### What simulation or experiment should I perform next?


## Making data machine actionable

How can we generate an effective assistent for chemists that can answer questions such as "find all MOFs that can made in one step in a solvothermal synthesis in water?"

To answer questions like these, we need data in a form that cannot only be _read_ by a machine, but also _understood_ in order to perform actions. 

In order to ensure that data is an afterthought in chemistry, I got involved in the development of an open-source ELN, the [cheminfo ELN](cheminfo.github.io) (which development is lead by Luc Patiny, our [perspective article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-00910-7) gives a good overview of our vision for the development of this platform).
In contrast to many other ELNs, machine-actionable data is at the core of the ELN. This enables us to perform various actions on the data, directly in the browser.


#### Request simulations to compare experimental data with theoretical predictions


#### Create digital supporting information documents
