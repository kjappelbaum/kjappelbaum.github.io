# 👨🏼‍🏫 Teaching 

I take great pleasure in teaching and mentoring. I gave a number of lectures and tutorials on data management and machine learning at EPFL and the [MolSim winterschool](https://www.acmm.nl/events/molsim2023/).
Starting from my undergrad at TU Munich, I have been a teaching assistant and mentoring students.

## Making molecules vibrate

One of my favorite teaching experiences was developing what we call a “virtual laboratory.”

## Introduction to machine learning

I have been lucky to introduce students to machine learning. For this, I have developed a series of lectures and a hands-on exercise, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/ml_molsim).
Usually, we also host a Kaggle competition as part of the hands-on exercise. You can find an example of the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/molsim-2023-ml-challenge/overview).
Typically, I like to add some live-coding examples to the lecture. You can find the notebooks for those examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/molsim-ml-code-examples).
