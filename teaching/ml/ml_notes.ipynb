        "To design new materials, we need to know their properties. \n",
        "There are two main routes to get the properties of a material: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Perform an experiment to measure them \n",
        "2. Perform a simulation to “measure” them in silico \n",
        "\n",
        "In many cases, performing an experiment is time-consuming and, hence, expensive. Also high-fidelity simulations can be very costly. \n",
        "[Fidelity expresses the exactness with which a surrogate represents the truth. In the context of ML you might also see the term multi-fidelity, which means that the approach uses multiple approximations with different levels of fidelity, e.g. density-functional theory and coupled cluster theory]{.aside}\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, there is a need for methods that can help us to predict the properties of materials with high fidelity and low cost. In this lecture, we will see that _supervised machine learning_ (ML) is a powerful tool to achieve this goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, this tool can be used in many different ways.\n",

        "Machine learning can be used in multiple ways to make high-fidelity predictions of materials less expensive.\n",
        "[Note that reducing the cost has been a challenge for chemists and material scientists for a long time. Dirac famously said \"The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved. [...] approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation\"]{.aside}\n",

Quantum chemists have developed different approximations to this problem. However, since they are all kinds of functions that map positions of atoms (and atom types, and in some cases electron densities/coordinates) to energies, we can learn those functions with ML.\n",

For example, see [this one by Unke et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c01111) as well as the ones by [Deringer et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00022) and [Behler](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00868) in the same [issue of Chemical Reviews](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/chreay/121/16).\n",

        "2. _Directly predict the properties of interest_ Instead of computing the properties of interest using a molecular simulations, we can build models that learn the $f(\\mathrm{structure}) \\to \\mathrm{property}$ mapping directly. The basis for this mapping might be experimental data or high-fidelity computational data.\n",

        "    Also about this approach, there are many review articles. I also wrote [one](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00004), focussing on porous materials.\n",

It is always important to mention with respect to what operation something is invariant and equivariant; if people don't mention this they often refer to the symmetry operations of the Euclidean group which comprises all translations, rotations, and reflection.  Invariant means that the property of interest does not change under those operations. Equivariant means that it changes in the same way. The energy, for example, is invariant and the forces are equivariant.]{.aside}\n",

        "\n",
        "Broadly speaking, there are three different ways to build models that respect symmetries.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. _Data augmentation_: This is the most straightforward approach. We can generate new data points by applying the symmetries to the existing data points. For example, we can generate new conformers by rotating the existing conformers. This approach is very simple to implement, but it can be very expensive. For example, if we want to generate new conformers by rotating the existing conformers, we need to generate a new conformer for every rotation.\n",
        "This approach is often used for computer vision pipelines in which you might want to detect a cat in an image independent of the orientation. In this case, you can generate new images by rotating the existing images.\n",
        "2. _Features that are invariant/equivariant_ : This approach is more sophisticated. We can build features that are invariant/equivariant to the symmetries we want to respect. For example, we can build features that are invariant to rotation. In the case of force field such features are bond lengths and angles. This is approach is widely used in ML for chemistry and materials science.\n",
        "3. _Models that are invariant/equivariant_: Alternatively, one can build special models that can consume point clouds as inputs and are equivariant to the symmetries we want to respect. We will not discuss this in detail, but you can find starting points in this [perspective by Tess Smidt](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589597420302641).\n",

        "For understanding the curse of dimensionality, it is useful to consider a very simple ML model, the $k$-nearest neighbors model. In this model, we have a set of training points $\\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$, where $x_i$ is a vector of features and $y_i$ is the corresponding label. To make a prediction, we compute the distance between the input and all training points and return the mode of the labels of the $k$ closest training points.\n",
